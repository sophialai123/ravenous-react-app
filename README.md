## Ravenous App

---
 Fetch() will not function correctly due to [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) restrictions.

You can bypass this restriction with an API called [CORS Anywhere](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo). CORS Anywhere will take requests sent to its API endpoint, make them for the requesting app with the proper CORS permissions, and then return the response back to the requesting app.
